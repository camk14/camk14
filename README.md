- âš¡ Fun fact: A fun fact about computer speed is that the fastest supercomputer in the world (as of 2023), Frontier, can perform over 1 quintillion calculations per second! Thatâ€™s a 1 followed by 18 zerosâ€”or whatâ€™s known as 1 exaFLOP. To put it in perspective, if every human on Earth performed one calculation per second, it would take us over 4 years to do what Frontier does in just one second!
